This directory contains the MATLAB source codes used to produce the result of the paper:

Georges Aazan, Antoine Girard, Luca Greco, Paolo Mason. An Automata Theoretic Approach to Observer Design for Switched Linear Systems.

To produce the results of the first (academic) example, one shall excute "academic_algo_slow.m" and "academic_algo_fast.m".

To produce the results of the second (multicellular) example, one shall excute "multicellular_algo.m".

The file "PowerSet.m" is downloaded from mathworks.com and used to build our results.

Questions and bug reports can be sent to georges.aazan@lsv.fr.
